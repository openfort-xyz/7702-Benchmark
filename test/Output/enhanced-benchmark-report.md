## 🎯 Key Insights

### 🌟 Network Cost Analysis
- **Cheapest Network Overall**: OPTIMISM (consistently lowest costs across all operations)
- **Most Expensive Network**: MAINNET (highest transaction costs across all networks)
- **Best L2 Alternative**: BASE (good balance of cost and performance)

### 🔄 Direct vs Sponsored Transaction Analysis
- **Average Gas Overhead**: Sponsored transactions use ~321.8% more gas than direct transactions
- **Cost Premium**: Sponsored transactions cost more due to additional gas usage for UserOp handling
- **UX Trade-off**: Sponsored transactions provide better UX but at higher operational cost

### 💰 Total Cost Comparison
- **MAINNET**: Direct: $22.7559 | Sponsored: $6.9466
- **BASE**: Direct: $0.1774 | Sponsored: $0.0545
- **ARBITRUM**: Direct: $2.1556 | Sponsored: $0.6737
- **OPTIMISM**: Direct: $0.0311 | Sponsored: $0.0082

### 🔥 Operation Highlights
- **Most Expensive**: Deploy OPF (Direct) ($16.4848 on MAINNET)
- **Most Gas Intensive**: Deploy OPF (Direct) (5,001,063 gas)

### 💡 Recommendations
- **For Cost Optimization**: Use OPTIMISM network for ~90% cost savings vs MAINNET
- **For User Experience**: Consider sponsored transactions for better UX, budget ~322% extra gas
- **For Development**: BASE offers good cost-performance balance for testing and development
- **For High-Volume Operations**: The gas overhead of sponsored transactions can be significant at scale
