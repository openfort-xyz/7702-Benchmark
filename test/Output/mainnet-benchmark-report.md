## MAINNET Network Recommendations

### Mainnet Considerations
- **High Cost Network**: Average operation costs $1.4551
- **Use for Production**: Only for final production deployments
- **Optimize Gas**: Every gas unit counts - optimize heavily before deploying
- **Batch Operations**: Consider batching multiple operations to reduce total costs
- **Monitor Gas Prices**: Deploy during low congestion periods

### High-Cost Operations to Monitor
- **Deploy OPF** (Direct): $16.3935 - Consider optimization

### Most Cost-Efficient Operations
- **Approve ERC20** (Direct): $0.0198 - Great choice for high-frequency use
- **Transfer ERC20** (Direct): $0.0198 - Great choice for high-frequency use
- **Batch Execution** (Direct): $0.0245 - Great choice for high-frequency use
- **Send ETH** (Direct): $0.1324 - Great choice for high-frequency use
- **Approve ERC20 (UOP)** (Sponsored): $0.1907 - Great choice for high-frequency use

### Signature Method Recommendations
- **Standard UOP**: Avg $0.6608, 200,490 gas
- **Master Key**: Avg $1.7837, 541,140 gas
- **P256 Signature**: Avg $0.8473, 257,068 gas
- **P256 Direct**: Avg $1.0677, 323,924 gas
- **Session Key EOA**: Avg $0.2380, 72,231 gas
