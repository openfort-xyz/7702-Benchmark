# Network Cost Analysis: EIP-7702 Operations

## Overview

A comprehensive cost analysis of EIP-7702 account operations across four major networks:
- **Ethereum** (L1)
- **Base** (OP Stack L2)
- **Polygon** (L1)
- **Optimism** (OP Stack L2)

All costs are calculated using real gas consumption from benchmarks and current network pricing data captured on **2025-10-27**.

### Calculated L1 Data Fees (OP Stack)

Using the Ecotone formula with estimated UserOperation size of 500 bytes:

| Network | L1 Data Fee (wei) | L1 Data Fee (USD) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Base** | 2,185,319 | $0.00909 |

**Key Insights**:
- Complex DeFi operations show gas costs 3-5x higher than simple transfers
- Polygon provides 36x cost savings vs Ethereum for WebAuthn swaps
- Base total costs dominated by L1 fee (~70% of total for complex operations)
- Optimism L1 fee becomes smaller percentage as execution gas increases

**Key Insights**:
- **RootKey operations**: Most expensive are key registration (126k-278k gas), cheapest are permission removal (30k-158k gas)
- **WebAuthn MasterKey operations**: All operations range from 300k-468k gas, adding ~190k-195k gas overhead vs RootKey
- **Network costs**:
  - Ethereum: $0.017-$0.255 (highest)
  - Base: $0.010-$0.022 (most consistent, L1 fee dominates)
  - Polygon: $0.002-$0.003 (lowest for most operations)
  - Optimism: $0.020-$0.021 (L1 fee floor dominates)
- **Best network**: Polygon for infrequent admin operations, Base for frequent WebAuthn operations

| **Total Setup (Deploy + Init w/ SessionKey)** | 5,430,571 | $2.96089 | $0.17166 | $0.03224 | $0.06167 |

**Key Insights**:
- **Contract Deployment**: One-time cost of ~$2.74 on Ethereum, $0.03 on Polygon, $0.04 on Optimism, $0.15 on Base
- **Account Initialization**: $0.16-0.22 on Ethereum, $0.017-0.021 on Base, $0.0017-0.0024 on Polygon
- **SessionKey Registration Overhead**: Adding SessionKey during initialization costs +121k gas (+41.9%)
- **Network comparisons**:
  - **Polygon**: Most cost-effective for deployment ($0.03 vs $2.74 on Ethereum = 98.9% savings)
  - **Base**: L1 data fee ($0.009) is negligible compared to large deployment gas cost
  - **Optimism**: L1 fee dominates for low-gas initialization but is minimal for deployment
  - **Total setup cost**: Polygon offers 91x cheaper total setup vs Ethereum
